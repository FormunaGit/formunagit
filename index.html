      <p>Hey there! I'm Formuna. This is my website. I'm a programmer, as you may have come to realise.</p>
      <p>I chose to be a programmer because I like computers and seeing things work due to my actions.</p>
      <p>I started this website as a little place where I can just put my opinions on the internet.</p>
